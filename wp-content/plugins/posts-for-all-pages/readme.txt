Allows to distribute posts on different pages by means of categories.

== Description ==

Allows to distribute posts on different pages by means of categories.

Do you want your posts to be displayed on other pages than the standard post page? This plugin gives the possibility to display posts on different pages. All posts assigned to the default category still belong to the standard page. For all other pages the plugin permits to assign any categories to this page to make the corresponding posts be shown on that page.

The functionality of rendering posts at multiple pages requires that the applied theme operates with the standard page structure.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `posts-for-all-pages.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip `posts-for-all-pages.zip`.
3. Activate the plugin in the admin menu 'Plugins'.
